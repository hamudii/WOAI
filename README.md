# WOAI
**What are we trying to achieve?**

With WOAI, our goal is to empower individuals who prefer working out at home by providing a comprehensive self-assistance tool. We aim to address the challenges people face when exercising independently, focusing on improving workout form and overall fitness experience. Our goal is to offer a user-friendly and effective solution that caters to the unique needs of those pursuing home-based fitness.

**Has anything been done before?**

While there have been apps, like "Workout," that provide information about the correct form for various exercises, we identified a specific gap in real-time form tracking. WOAI aims to overcome the limitation of existing solutions by providing real-time tracking capabilities. This ensures that users receive immediate feedback on their form, enhancing the overall effectiveness of their workouts. Through continuous innovation, we strive to set WOAI apart in the fitness app landscape, addressing a key aspect that was previously underserved. User feedback and market research continue to guide us in refining and improving our unique approach.

**How to Use the App**
1. Install the mobile app on your mobile device.
2. Open the app and register your account.
3. Login with your registered account.
4. Choose the desired push up length, for example: 1-minute push up.
5. Orientate the mobile device in landscape position, and start the push up countdown.
6. Do the push up as much as possible in the countdown period.
7. The push up activity will be saved in the activity history.

# Step by Step Replication Guide
1. Identify the Problem
We observe and realize that many people do push-ups with incorrect technique, which can potentially cause injury to the body.
The cost of hiring a personal trainer can sometimes be out of reach for many individuals.

2. Research
Conduct thorough market research and user surveys to understand the importance of workout technique, especially correct push-up technique.
The findings from this research became the basis for the development of WOAI, an application designed to help individuals improve their push-up technique. The aim of this application is to provide effective guidance for users in starting a healthy lifestyle, without requiring high costs for a personal trainer.

3. Proposed Solutions
Our mobile app, WOAI, offers a number of features for understanding and improving push-up movements.
These features include real-time movement prediction, providing real-time movement feedback, automatically calculating push-ups, saving the entire push-up history, and creating a summary of each push-up session.

4. Data Collection
We collected data on upper and lower push-up movements as a dataset.

5. Data Preprocessing


6. Machine Learning Models


7. Placement
Our machine learning models are applied to mobile apps and TFLite so they can be accessed for real-time predictions without having to wait for a response from the API.

8.API
We developed an API using Golang to store user data such as auth, training results history, and training summary.

9. Mobile App
The mobile app is developed using Kotlin, designed to be easy to use and intuitive, offering a seamless user experience.
