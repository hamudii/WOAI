**What are we trying to achieve?**

With WOAI, our goal is to empower individuals who prefer working out at home by providing a comprehensive self-assistance tool. We aim to address the challenges people face when exercising independently, focusing on improving workout form and overall fitness experience. Our goal is to offer a user-friendly and effective solution that caters to the unique needs of those pursuing home-based fitness.

**Has anything been done before?**

While there have been apps, like "Workout," that provide information about the correct form for various exercises, we identified a specific gap in real-time form tracking. WOAI aims to overcome the limitation of existing solutions by providing real-time tracking capabilities. This ensures that users receive immediate feedback on their form, enhancing the overall effectiveness of their workouts. Through continuous innovation, we strive to set WOAI apart in the fitness app landscape, addressing a key aspect that was previously underserved. User feedback and market research continue to guide us in refining and improving our unique approach.
